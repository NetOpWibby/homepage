# homepage

> Source code for the coolest homepage with the coolest domain name, **webb.page**.



## Prerequisites

- Node 13



## Installation

```sh
$ npm i
```



## Development

```sh
$ npm run watch
```



## Production

```sh
$ npm start
```



## Tests

When Sapper supports TypeScript, proper tests will follow. Right now, there are only tests for syntax.



## Notes

`@inc/uchu` is a private dependency hosted on a private npm-esque instance, so building my homepage locally will not be seamless for you. It might become publicly available...someday.
